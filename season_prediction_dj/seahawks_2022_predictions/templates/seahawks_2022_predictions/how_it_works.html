        <head>
        You are trying to accurately guess the score of upcoming Seahawk games. You are graded based solely on how closely you guess the point differential,
        not at all on how close to total points scored (over/under) you are. 
        
        For instance if you guess the Seahawks will win by a score of 45 to 42 and they win 3 to 0 you
        will recieve a higher grade than if you guessed they would win by a score of 47 to 40. Is this dumb? I don't know, ask yourself; is football dumb? Is life
        dumb? 
        
        Yes. It is. So what. Below is a breakout of how exactly your point differential or 'spread' accuracy grades out.
